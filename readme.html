<p>WhatsApp uses your phone's Internet connection (4G/3G/2G/EDGE or Wi-Fi, as available) to send and receive messages to your friends and family.
       You do not have to pay for every message</p>

<p>They store messages only til such time when the user's device gets connected to the network, with a maximum period of 30 me when the usedays from the date of the message. 
   So, if the user doesn't get connected to Whatsapp servers in 30 days, those messages will get deleted from their servers</p>. 

<p>WhatsApp now, also lets you delete and revoke messages you sent by mistake.
  To delete messages you'll get a new option after you select delete, allowing you to “delete for everyone” instead of just from your own device. 
  you can also give stars to those texts you seem to like and those are known as starred messages.</p>

<p>Replying to messages. The Reply feature allows you to respond to a particular message, both in a group and in an individual chat. 
  On Android, tap and hold the message to highlight, and tap Reply at the top of the chat. Then, type and send your response.</p>

<p>The most popular smartphone messaging service WhatsApp is now able to communicate with friends from their PC. 
   The feature is called "WhatsApp Web," which gives its users the ability to read and send messages directly from their web browsers.</p>

<p>The WhatsApp web client uses your phone to connect and send messages – in a sense, everything is mirrored. Your web session stays active as long as your phone has a connection to the internet. 
   This also means that your phone's data connection is constantly being used</p>.

<p>WhatsApp Web is not exactly hackable , but there is a way, you can inject JavaScript on to WhatsApp Web page (DOM) and scrap messages and contacts of user.
   Chrome has security policy which prevents injection of script from any external source</p>
